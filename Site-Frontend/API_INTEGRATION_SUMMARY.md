## 📝 Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=your_backend_url_here
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Start your backend server
2. Start your frontend development server
3. Test all form submissions
4. Verify data is being saved to your database
5. Test error scenarios (network failures, validation errors)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure your backend allows requests from frontend domain
2. **404 Errors**: Verify backend routes are properly registered
3. **Network Errors**: Check if backend server is running
4. **Validation Errors**: Ensure required fields match backend expectations

### Debug Tips:
- Check browser Network tab for API calls
- Check browser Console for JavaScript errors
- Verify backend logs for error messages
- Use backend API testing tools (Postman, etc.) to verify endpoints work
